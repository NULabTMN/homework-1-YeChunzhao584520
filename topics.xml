		"It has been an open secret for some
		time past that I am desirous of leading
		another expedition to south polar re
		gions. I am glad now to be able to state
		that through the generosity of a friend
		I can announce that the-expedltion will
		start nest year, with the object of cross
		ing the south polar continent from- sea
		to sea.
		"I have taken the liberty of calling
		the expedition the 'Imperial Transant
		arctlc Expedition,' because I feel not
		dnly that the people of these islands,
		but our kinsmen In all latds under the
		Union Jack, will be willing to assist
		toward carrying out the full program
		of the exploration to which my com
		rades and myself aro pled red."
		Sir Ernest Shackleton will start from
		a South American port, with the object

				Chance of getting through this season.

				Sidney, N. S. W., March 24
				Lieut. Sir Ernest Shackleton
				has returned from his Antarc
				tic expedition.,.
				News of tha achievements of
				the expedition is withheld for
				the present.
				Th adventure of Lieut.Nsir Ernest
				Shackleton heading the British trans-
				Atlantic expedition, had a three-fold
				purpose to navigate Antarctica on a
				meridian to secure for the British flag
				the honor of being the first national
				emblem tljus to be taken from sea to
				tea across this south polar realm, and
				to conduct scientific work relating,
				among other phases, to meteorology,
				geography, geology and geodetic sur
				veys. Funds for the. purpose amount
				ing to more than $300,000 were raised
				including $50,000 from the British
				government.
				The expedition left England in two
				sections about six weeks after the
				European war began, but it was not
				until early In January, 1915 after de
				lay due to unfavorable ice conditions
				that the party headed by Sir Ernest
				himself set off on their long voyage
				from South .Georgia, an uninhabited
				island in the South Atlantic Ocean
				about 800 miles due. east' of Cape
				Horn, for Ross Sea on the other side
				of the South Pole.1 i
				From Tasmania, on the New Zea
				land .side of the Antarctic the second
				section meanwhile had sailed, also for
				Ross Sea, there to meet Sir Ernest's
				expedition with supplies necessaryfor
				both sections to return to New Zea
				land. Sir Ernest hoped originally to
				come out of the Antarctic by April,
				1915 but conditions made necessary a
				change of plan. The section which
				started from Tasmania was forced to
				spend the winter of 1915-16 at Ross
				Sea to await Sir Ernest's arrival which
				had been expected some time this
				month.

				EXPLORER IS CALLED BY DEATH
				Dies On Antarctic Voyage; News Delayed Three Weeks

				Buenos Aires, Jan. 30. (By Associated Press.) More than three weeks elapsed between the death of Sir Ernest Shackleton, the British explorer, and its announcement to the world, made yesterday when the body arrived at Montevideo. The delay, La Nacion Montevideo correspondent telegraphs, was ascribed by Captain L. Hussey, who accompanied the body, as due to a series of wireless mishaps.

				Sir Ernest died aboard the steamship Quest, on which he was making another Antarctic voyage, while anchored off South Georgia Island on January 6. His body was taken to Montevideo on the first leg of the trip home aboard the Norwegian steamship Professor Cruvel.

				Shackleton, in the Nimrod, returned South in 1908, explored the Beardmore Glacier and “pioneered” the way to the Pole.

				Shackleton, also honored by his sovereign, returned South in the Endurance in 1914. He discovered the Caird coast, lost his ship in the ice, drifted 457 days to Elephant Island and finally reached South Georgia. He attempted still another expedition in the Quest, but died en route January 4, 1922.
