				Sidney, N. S. W., March 24
				Lieut. Sir Ernest Shackleton
				has returned from his Antarc
				tic expedition.,.
				News of tha achievements of
				the expedition is withheld for
				the present.
				Th adventure of Lieut.Nsir Ernest
				Shackleton heading the British trans-
				Atlantic expedition, had a three-fold
				purpose to navigate Antarctica on a
				meridian to secure for the British flag
				the honor of being the first national
				emblem tljus to be taken from sea to
				tea across this south polar realm, and
				to conduct scientific work relating,
				among other phases, to meteorology,
				geography, geology and geodetic sur
				veys. Funds for the. purpose amount
				ing to more than $300,000 were raised
				including $50,000 from the British
				government.
				The expedition left England in two
				sections about six weeks after the
				European war began, but it was not
				until early In January, 1915 after de
				lay due to unfavorable ice conditions
				that the party headed by Sir Ernest
				himself set off on their long voyage
				from South .Georgia, an uninhabited
				island in the South Atlantic Ocean
				about 800 miles due. east' of Cape
				Horn, for Ross Sea on the other side
				of the South Pole.1 i
				From Tasmania, on the New Zea
				land .side of the Antarctic the second
				section meanwhile had sailed, also for
				Ross Sea, there to meet Sir Ernest's
				expedition with supplies necessaryfor
				both sections to return to New Zea
				land. Sir Ernest hoped originally to
				come out of the Antarctic by April,
				1915 but conditions made necessary a
				change of plan. The section which
				started from Tasmania was forced to
				spend the winter of 1915-16 at Ross
				Sea to await Sir Ernest's arrival which
				had been expected some time this
				month.

				EXPLORER IS CALLED BY DEATH

				Buenos Aires, Jan. 30. (By Associated Press.) More than three weeks elapsed between the death of Sir Ernest Shackleton, the British explorer, and its announcement to the world, made yesterday when the body arrived at Montevideo. The delay, La Nacion Montevideo correspondent telegraphs, was ascribed by Captain L. Hussey, who accompanied the body, as due to a series of wireless mishaps.

				Sir Ernest died aboard the steamship Quest, on which he was making another Antarctic voyage, while anchored off South Georgia Island on January 6. His body was taken to Montevideo on the first leg of the trip home aboard the Norwegian steamship Professor Cruvel.

				Warrant charges Moyer, Haywood, and Pettibone with exploding a bomb that killed Steunenberg.
				According to the complaints, the three men are directly charged with the murder of former Governor Frank Steunenberg of Idaho, which occurred in Caldwell on December 30, 1905.
				The complaints allege that they conspired with others to carry out the assassination and provided the funds to execute the plot.
				Harry Orchard, already in custody for the Steunenberg murder, has reportedly made a confession implicating these men.
				His confession includes details about various crimes in the Cripple Creek and Telluride mining districts, and other violent acts attributed to the Western Federation of Miners.
				The prisoners were transported secretly to Idaho, and additional arrests are being pursued.

				Charles H. Moyer, William D. Haywood, and G. A. Pettibone, leaders of the Western Federation of Miners, were arrested in Denver and secretly transported to Boise, Idaho. They are accused of conspiring in the assassination of former Idaho Governor Frank Steunenberg. Extradition papers for their arrest were signed days prior by Governor McDonald in a highly secretive process to prevent interference.

				The arrests were carefully planned, with Moyer being detained as he prepared to leave the city, Haywood intercepted exiting an elevator, and Pettibone taken quietly. None were informed of the others' arrests until their transportation to the station. The men were placed on a special train under heavy guard, escorted by armed deputies.

				The Idaho authorities allege that the Federation leaders financed and orchestrated the plot to assassinate Steunenberg. This follows claims made in a confession by Harry Orchard, who detailed a series of violent acts and assassinations tied to the Federation, including the use of bombs and other forms of violence during labor disputes.

				Governor McDonald, speaking from Colorado Springs, expressed surprise at the use of a special train for the transfer, noting that he had no knowledge of such arrangements. The arrests mark a significant escalation in efforts to hold the Federation accountable for alleged crimes.

				**Harry Orchard's Confession and Haywood Trial**

				Harry Orchard's confession has implicated prominent leaders of the Western Federation of Miners, including President Charles H. Moyer, Secretary William D. Haywood, and former executive board member G. A. Pettibone, in a series of assassinations and violent conspiracies across the Rocky Mountain mining districts. Among the crimes disclosed is the assassination of former Idaho Governor Frank Steunenberg.

				Orchard's confession details:
				- Plots to assassinate key figures, such as Colorado Supreme Court Justices and Governor Peabody.
				- Use of bombs and other violent means to eliminate targets.
				- The existence of an "inner circle" in the Western Federation of Miners, based in Denver, which orchestrated these crimes.
				- The failed attempt to assassinate Colorado Justice Goddard using an unexploded bomb later recovered by detectives.

				**Details of the Conspiracy Against Steunenberg**:
				Orchard confessed that he acted alone in executing the Caldwell plot to kill Steunenberg. Initially planning to shoot him on Christmas Eve, Orchard changed tactics and planted explosives under the sidewalk near the governor's home. The detonations killed Steunenberg.

				**Arrests and Legal Proceedings**:
				- Moyer, Haywood, and Pettibone were secretly arrested in Denver and transported under heavy guard to Boise, Idaho, aboard a special train. To avoid public attention, the train made no stops in major cities, and all transfers occurred in secluded areas.
				- Upon arrival, the accused were placed in separate cells in the Idaho penitentiary. They have been charged directly with the murder of Governor Steunenberg.

				**Additional Revelations**:
				Orchard's revelations reportedly include numerous other violent acts committed during labor disputes in Telluride, Cripple Creek, and other mining regions. Efforts are underway to apprehend additional conspirators, including Jack Simpkins and Adams, believed to be hiding in Oregon.

				Governor Gooding of Idaho has expressed confidence in the confession's credibility, stating it reveals a level of criminal activity rarely seen in the nation's history.

				**Significance**:
				The trial of Moyer, Haywood, and Pettibone is expected to draw national attention, not only for its implications about organized labor's role in political violence but also for the precedent it sets in addressing such conspiracies. Detectives are still verifying details of the confession, which has already proven to be a critical piece of evidence.

				**Public Reaction**:
				The arrests and Orchard's confession have shocked the nation, revealing the extent of violence in labor disputes and the clandestine operations of the Western Federation of Miners' leadership.

				MINERS LOSE APPEAL. EXTRA DITION LAWFUL.
				Supreme Court Will Not Interfere in Steunenberg Murder Cases.

				Washington, Dec. 3.
				The Supreme Court decided to-day the habeas corpus cases of Moyer, Haywood, and Pettibone, the representatives of the Western Federation of Miners, who are held in prison in Idaho on the charge of complicity in the murder of ex-Governor Steunenberg, adversely to the men. The opinion was by Justice Harlan. The effect of the decision was that the men will continue to be held in confinement for trial in Idaho.

				Charles H. Moyer is president, W. D. Haywood is secretary-treasurer, and George A. Pettibone is a member of the Western Federation of Miners. They are now in prison in Canyon City, Idaho, under a charge of murdering ex-Governor Steunenberg of that state, although it was not charged that they were present when the crime was committed. The cases came to the Supreme Court on an appeal from a decision of the Idaho federal court refusing to grant writs of habeas corpus.

				TRIAL OF HAYWOOD BEGUN IN BOISE
				One of Four Defendants Charged With Complicity in Murder of Ex-Gov Steunenberg

				William D. Haywood, secretary and treasurer of the Western Federation of Miners, has been placed on trial for complicity in the murder of former Governor Frank Steunenberg of Idaho on December 30, 1905.
				Haywood is one of four defendants, including Charles H. Moyer (President of the Federation), George A. Pettibone (a former executive member), and Harry Orchard.
				Harry Orchard, the key witness for the state, has confessed and provided details implicating the accused. His testimony is crucial to the prosecution's case.
				The trial's outcome for Haywood may determine the course of action for the cases against Moyer and Pettibone.
				Judge Fremont Wood is presiding over the trial.
				The case has garnered significant attention, with tight security and measures to ensure a fair trial.

				“Miss Jarvis original idea embraced the simultaneous observance in every part of the world of the love and reverence which all men and women owe their mothers. The white carnation was especially chosen because of its whiteness, which stands for purity, its form and fragrance representing beauty and love, its wide field of growth and lasting qualities symbolizing charity and faithfulness—a true mother’s virtues.”

				"CHILDREN TO CELEBRATE TOMORROW - Sons and Daughters Unite to Commemorate Mothers' Day in the City"

				How many of the Juniors have heard of Miss Annie Jarvis?
				She is the woman who brought about the establishment of a "mothers' day" in almost every state in the union, not to mention the nations of the world and whose indefatigable efforts have served to arouse in every man, woman and child a sense of the beauty of motherhood and the duty we owe to our mothers.
				Miss Jarvis is a Philadelphia woman. A few years ago, alone and unaided, she started the "mothers' day" movement, and so eloquent was her plea that the idea found instant and hearty acceptance. Since then the plan has been gaining ground and within the last four years the setting aside of a mothers' day has been accepted and indorsed by nearly every governor in the union and many of the crowned heads of Europe.

				"Backward, turn backward, O Time, in thy flight,
				Make me a child again, just for a night;
				Mother, come back from the echoless shore,
				Take me again to your heart as of yore,
				Kiss from my forehead the furrows of care,
				Smooth the few silver threads out of my hair;
				Over my slumbers your loving watch keep,
				Rock me to sleep, mother, rock me to sleep."

				Wear a Flower.
				"White flower for Mother dead
				Bright flower for Mother living."

				It was five years ago that Miss Anna Jarvis, of Philadelphia, conceived the idea of selecting one day of the year upon which the devotion to mothers' memory should be observed, and the second Sunday in May being the day upon which fell the anniversary of her mother's death, that day was chosen by her as Mothers' Day.

				Miss Jarvis wrote to churches, societies, public officials, noted people, and the press, and all joined in the movement which she had originated. It has spread so rapidly that this year a majority of the governors of states have issued proclamations setting aside tomorrow as Mothers' Day and suggesting that it be made one of the state's memorial days.

				The original plan was that each one wishing to honor his mother would wear a white carnation, but the demand proving greater than the supply, it was decided to wear a white carnation for the dead and a bright flower for the living. So wear a flower tomorrow, white or bright, "in honor of the best mother in the world, your mother."

				FOUNDER OF "MOTHERS' DAY" THANKS AD MEN FOR CO-OPERATION
				Miss Anna Jarvis Gives Advertising Men Credit for Plan

				The founder of Mother's Day and the Mother's Day International Association wishes to thank with sincere appreciation every member of the Associated Advertising Clubs who has ever helped for Mother's Day success.

				Mother's Day was first promoted by Philadelphia papers, and through the cooperation of the press of this and other countries, it has become an international celebration. No movement of the century has obtained so wonderful a hold on the hearts of the people under such a multitude of difficulties and limitations in establishing and promoting it. The press, however, has been the one stanch and good friend of Mother's Day since its early days.

				Mother's Day is for the honor of the home, especially its motherhood, by older people as well as children, and by the nation, that must look to the home as the fountainhead of that which is good and true.

				The celebration always occurs the second Sunday in May in homes and churches. Schools, clubs, etc., celebrate during the week preceding.

				The Mother's Day badge is the white carnation, emblem of the beauty, truth, and fidelity of mother love.

				The slogan of Mother's Day is, "In honor of the best mother who ever lived, the mother of my heart."

				As friends of this Mother's Day movement, which so distinctly honors your own mothers, will you not help us to promote in our way a worldwide, simultaneous celebration of Mother's Day, with the white carnation as the emblem to be worn, on the second Sunday of May, and letters or acts of affection to homes, etc., as one of the simple, easy ways of celebrating?

				ANNA JARVIS, Founder.

				MOTHER 0' MINE
				Rudyard Kipling

				If I were hanged on the highest hill,
				Mother o' mine, O mother o' mine!
				I know whose love would follow me still,
				Mother o' mine, O mother o' mine!

				If I were drowned in the deepest sea,
				Mother o' mine, O mother o' mine!
				I know whose tears would come down to me,
				Mother o' mine, O mother o' mine!

				If I were cursed in body and soul,
				Mother o' mine, O mother o' mine!
				I know whose prayers would make me whole,
				Mother o' mine, O mother o' mine!
